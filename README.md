## Introduction

In the world of software development, having a solid project structure is crucial. The Cookiecutter Modular Project Template allows you to kickstart your projects with a clear layout. Whether you are building a client-server application, working with protocols like MQTT or RTSP, or developing an LLM-based system, this template provides the foundation you need.

## Features

- **Modular Design**: Create and manage modules easily.
- **Protocol Support**: Built-in support for various protocols such as IMAP, MQTT, and RTSP.
- **Client-Server Architecture**: Structure your project for both client and server components.
- **Easy Setup**: Get started quickly with minimal configuration.
- **Extensible**: Add or modify modules as your project evolves.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Cookiecutter
- Git

### Installation

To install the Cookiecutter tool, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install cookiecutter
```

Once you have Cookiecutter installed, you can download the template. Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/muhds5841/cookiecutter/releases) to get the latest version.

## Usage

To create a new project using this template, run the following command:

```bash
cookiecutter https://github.com/muhds5841/cookiecutter
```

Follow the prompts to configure your project. You can specify project name, author, and other settings.

## Project Structure

The template provides a well-defined structure. Here‚Äôs a brief overview:

```
my_project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ client/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ modules/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/
```

- **src/**: Contains the source code for your project.
- **client/**: Directory for client-side code.
- **server/**: Directory for server-side code.
- **modules/**: Contains reusable modules.
- **tests/**: Directory for unit tests.

## Modules

Modules are the building blocks of your project. You can create, update, and manage them easily. Each module can have its own dependencies and can be developed independently.

### Creating a Module

To create a new module, simply add a new directory under `src/modules/` and include the necessary files. For example:

```
src/modules/my_module/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ my_module.py
```

### Using a Module

To use a module in your project, import it as you would any other Python module:

```python
from src.modules.my_module import MyClass
```

## Protocols

This template supports various protocols to facilitate communication between components. Below are some key protocols you can implement:

### MQTT

MQTT is a lightweight messaging protocol ideal for IoT applications. To use MQTT in your project, you can include the `paho-mqtt` library in your `requirements.txt`.

### RTSP

RTSP is used for streaming media. You can implement RTSP functionality in your server module to handle media streams.

### IMAP

IMAP is used for email retrieval. You can create a module to manage email interactions using the `imaplib` library.

## Contributing
